# Infinitweet
Say Goodbye to Character Limits - Free!

Infinitweet is an app that can take any amount of text, and convert it into an image for sharing on Twitter. Not only that, but it creates these images in a 2x1 aspect ratio, optimal for viewing in Twitter's image preview without even having to click through to the picture. All of the magic happens locally, on your device, so you can always generate Infinitweets even without a network connection (though you do need a connection to share the images, of course). 

This Chrome implementation of Infinitweet works using HTML5 Canvas. For the original iPhone app, see the [Infinitweet Free](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubencodes/Infinitweet-Free/) repository.

An implementation of Infinitweet was featured in `Apple Watch for Developers`, an Apress Media book.
